# TypeScript

## Introduction

This is a basic web app to learn TypeScript. The app is going to randomly generate two different entities (User and Company) with location (latitude and longitude) property tied to it. Then I am going to show them as markers on the map using Google Maps API inside the browser

## What is TypeScript?

- TypeScript is JavaScript with syntax for types
- TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.
- Find libraries with types: https://www.typescriptlang.org/dt/search

## Dependencies

- Parcel
- Faker
- Google maps

## Configurations

- Install the dependencies `npm install`
- Start the webapp `npx parcel index.html`
